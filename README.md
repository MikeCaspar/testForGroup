testForGroup
=============================

testForGroup (experimental role)


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MikeCaspar/testForGroup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MikeCaspar/testForGroup)

**this role is not ready.. do not use !**

This role is intended to be used with the maintain_ / test_ loop presented at AnsibleFest 2016 in SFO

- *test roles are intended to run in read only (to confirm a negative or positive test state)*

- *Should you try this role on another platform, please either do a Pull Request for the new platform or feel free to email me to ask that it be added.*


The original slides for the test/maintain loop can be read about [here](http://www.slideshare.net/MikeCaspar/testing-for-infrastructure-as-code-for-ansiblefest-2016-64540514).

Tests during this part of the loop are created via a _test.yml file that can be separately executed from _maintain playbooks.

This allows a test first/test parallel type approach with the ability to also use _test.yml as a form of governance check.

To provide samples to those that wish to use this approach, I decided it was a good idea to share pre-defined exmaple roles for those that wish to take this approach and do not want to start from scratch.

The intent is to allow teams working on infrastructure to use existing ansible yaml syntax without having to learn python development.
